Full Review","Firstly, I would say the dark mode is good, but in bottom navigation bar, if the colour scheme of button is changed to blue and notification of bottom navigation button is changed to red, it would look better. Also, there r many songs which are not available which is sometimes annoying.","In the current version the offline songs in the phone and wynk songs cant be played together.

How to fix it, please?",Overall a really good app but it would be really helpful if there was an album that would add all the online songs alphabetically on the go with one tap instead of adding each song into a specific playlist. It would be more Convenient to sort all the songs.,Airtel says you can set your favourite song as hellotune which is absolutely not true.Very few choices to set as hellotune in airtel.actually there are very few .atleast give us some option to create our own.,I loved this app and been using it since 3 yrs but with the last update it ruiden every thing. Wink cannot detect all of my offline song + the queue system of the previous version were far good than this. I want my previous queue.,"There used to be a search option only for the offline songs which showed the result of the downloaded songs available, and now its removed, i want that feature Wynk.",Everything is so perfect but you should add more independent artists with good profile pictures and better collection of songs with their respective artists like Spotify and u should try to add more and more songs and lyrics for them.,I have beennl a big fan of wynk for many yrs now but suddenly nw the app keeps crashing and the player keeps stopping but once I go into the player it starts playing again..it's srsly exasperating....please fix this.....,"App became too commercial and too many ads inbetween.
