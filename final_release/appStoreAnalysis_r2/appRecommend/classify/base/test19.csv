"I love Tiktok. It's an amazing and easy platform to express yourself. My only problem with it is, it's only showing everyone the same thing.

Full Review","Super fun! You can make tons of friends and tons of videos on here. I used this app once for a school project because of the way you can cut the video and add text to it.

When I downloaded Tiktok here in my new phone but then I cannot login with my old account anymore. I had to create a new account in Tiktok. :(,"I love this game!!

Full Review","As much as the app is fun to use, there are some glaring downsides. First, the creators of this app have said that they actively block or shadowban videos of LGBTQ+ members, people of color, people with mental health issues or scars, and people considered ""overweight"". Also, TikTok has started to co...

Full Review","Honestly, tik Tok good app to make you laugh but other than that it's horrible, you have to have over 1000 fans to go live. It's very hard to get fans when you're not famous on anything else. And it takes up a lot of your battery. I'm like most of the people suck on their, so I suggest just don't do...

Full Review","It's a really good app, but I suggest to do something about the control of the content and the profile info's etc. Lately a lot of people have been doing explicit videos (p*ornography, heat, nudity etc) and sometimes it takes a lot of time to take down the videos or the profile pictures etc. (There ...
Full Review","It listens to you 24/7. I watched a TV series on Netflix and just started receiving videos about people playing the characters from the TV series. I never searched for the TV series, just talked about it around the house and watched it with my phone in the same room. It happened more than once, but ...
Full Review","The experience had been good but would have gotten two more star if this feature was available. Having the ability to change your video thumbnail after you post your video is huge.

Full Review","I do love this app, however, it could use some useful tools such as allowing caption editing after posting (some people do not like misspelled words in their caption), being able to reapply a sound to a video if the original creator rebukes their sound would be a considerate feature, AND we need a w...

So far I haven't had any problems except when I made an account I wasn't able to search videos or sounds. I deleted my account( at least I thought I did) and my account was still ...
Full Review","If this was fixed, I'd give it a much higher rate. You see, in October (I think) I had an account called ""@spacegirlsage"". However, people were begging for too much attention, and I gave up on it. In February, a friend borrowed my phone and used her account, and I thought I'd come back. However, I l...
Full Review","This is a really fun app. It will definetly keep you busy because it is really addicting. Some of the people on there, such as the Zoe Laverne fans, have gotten out of hand, but other than that, it's such a fun app to use.","I really love this app but I'm giving it 3 stars because I feel like it has so much potential that it hasn't reached yet. For example: imagine being able to categorize the videos you've liked. It would make it so much easier to go back when you are looking for something specific. They are working ou...

Full Review","App is generally fun, but stupid new features are ruining it. This ""Stitch"" feature needs to be either 1. removed entirely, 2. Only able to be used on the creators own videos and no one else's, or 3. Made separate from duets so that it can be disable at the creators discretion, rather than having to...

Full Review","I use this app almost every second of the day. It's so addictive! There's only a problem with shadow banning which is kinda annoying. Also, I think more people, especially cosplayers, should be verified. I've seen so many good dancers, artists, cosplayers and things like that! Overall this app is AM...
Full Review",This is a great app but there should definitely be a edit post option. There's been many times where I want to add an extra hashtag or a typo is in my post and my only option is to save it and redo everything which is a pain.,"Great app but major bias as to who's videos are seen. If you're not a stereotypical hot person (by the moderators standards) your videos are rarely pushed out to the public mainstream. Basically, if you're not ""hot"" and showing some skin, the moderators don't push your content and even sometimes unf...

Full Review","TikTok is often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, which makes it sound like it’s some online karaoke experience. But a closer comparison would be Vine, Twitter’s still sorely missed short-form video app whose content lives on as YouTube compilations. While it’s true that TikTok is home to some sta...
Full Review","Great app and community, but quality of video recording (whether recording in the app or externally and uploading) is absolute garbage.
