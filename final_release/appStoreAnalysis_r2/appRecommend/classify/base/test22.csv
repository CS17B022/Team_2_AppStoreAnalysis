"It's fast for sharing apps across Android devices, but persistent location and WiFi fidgeting with the newer versions are starting to put a halt on the app's performance. Aside from that and ad notifs, it's pretty alright. If you have the option to take this over Bluetooth transfers, take it. Normal...

It opens on my phone but there are way too many ads and some weird annoying little car thingy (like a floating chat head) that I can't find a way to get rid of. I agree with so many others.. This app used to be so awesome, but now it's worse than wasted space! So sad...
Full Review","Well it was good, and I can't say it is not at all now. This must be a Share and Transfer application, not a app store or a ad store. And a lot of updates.

Dear, share it team, if you're reading this comment please fix the connection problem ASAP. Unable to connect my phone to pc.",Sharing with this app is great. This app took sharing to a whole new level. The problem is the videos. It uses up more than normal storage and it has developed problems when connecting. It would be great to get the old school shareit for sharing files only.,"Never gonna use it ever again. This used to be a good app, but now it's just a hub for all fake news YouTube channels and all the push notifications that shows up are of deceptive, misleading, false, misinformed and unscientific YouTube videos.

Full Review",I have to say that the newer version is awful the apps can't detect my PC while using the older version it could run flawlessly to send file from my device to PC. Please fix this!,"Its been a long time using this app but today its became more complicated continue using this. It should be just a sharing file app, We accept the ads since its free but these music player, social videos, cleaner, etc, we dont need anymore since most of phone today has these features.","Just downgrade it back to like it was before this useless update Connecting to PC was so simple. And there were lesser useless ads and videos. If I wanted to watch videos, id choose YouTube. I use share it to just ""share"" files.","In initial days these app used to work like magic but as time passed the app has degraded to a point where it has become a burden.

It sucks so.i have no choice but to uninstall it.,"I enjoy the file sharing a lot, but I don't like the short video downloads. Tried without success to switch them off. You can't permanently delete the downloaded videos, even if you select NOT INTERESTED they keep coming back.","Literally a garbage app the main focus of app is to share anything from device to device but not now the app is for wasting time and putting garbage ads and videos and other junk stuff in it.

Its not good as compared to Apple Air drop and Samsung S Beam. Speed is relatively slow as compared to other competitors.,"Previously it was the best one but after passing days it became worst and worst.

For photos and app, no problems but the concern is on videos.","Your app is getting worse every update, need gps only for transfer file locally? R u kidding? And the ads is really anoyying, even my parent thought me visiting porn site becos ur video ads banner Come on dev u can do better than this.","Too many unnecessary content and sections, which makes the app run slower, and that is while the app doesn't do what it's mainly built for like 50% of the times (i.e. connection problem )",This app has fallen a long way from grace.
