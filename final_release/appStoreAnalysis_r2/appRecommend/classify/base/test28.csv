"This is the best app I've ever downloaded! You can scan PDFs on the go, and the images come out clear! Super convenient for receipts, worksheets, medical files, contracts, etc. so that you don't have to have a bunch of papers around the house that are hard to find. If I had one recommendation for th...
Full Review","Yep, it's awesome and magic. It magically crops and let's you adjust it, and has AMAZING magical filters that help you see you're documents clearly like you never have before. Just a side note, you DO NOT have to pay, they just keep on making you THINK you DO with all the pop ups about payment plans...
Full Review","I've used this app for several years. It was excellent to start and every bit as good now. Only a minor issue with registration for their Pro service. I'll get to it sometime. But I give 5 stars for the app use with successive Samsung Galaxy Note phones, and I've just started using the new Motor G S...
Full Review","My had this 1 day longer than the free trial and was charged for the month subscription. Which isn't a big deal, because it was my fault, but then I received fraudulent charges beginning the very next day (when prior to this, I hadn't used my bank card in over a week) and had to get a new bank card....
Full Review","The scanning functionality is quite good. However, the viewing functionality is absolutely horrible. Say you zoom in on a page in order to be able to read it more clearly. So now the full page (your scan) does not fit on your screen. If you're reading the left part of your page, you'll have to drag ...
Full Review","I used to love this app for it's simplicity and ease of use. I paid for the premium version. Then the app changed completely, with a new payment model, and I lost most of the premium features I'd paid for. The new version is buggy, with documents disappearing. It is no longer simple and intuitive, b...
Full Review","Very good application. You'll like it. Produces great sharp and clear images with a very high resolution. Very good quality photos with very many small pixels close to each other. That results to great photos. Congratulations to the team and developers that made this a success. It is application tha...
Full Review","It's ok. I've used it for over a year and nothing fancy. You're only limited to three folders for saving your scans though. Afterwards you have to pay for premium service. In addition, now their stupid watermark appears on ALL of your scans. Photos, documents, receipts, everything. Whereas in the pa...

Full Review","So the app works really good, however, you gotta pay a hella lot to get it to work, all features are paid, based on monthly subscription, there is even 2 plans, this thing is more expensive than inventing a pocket sized real scanner, I really don't know how can something be such expensive and disgus...
Full Review","Awesome app, bought the Pro version and have used it for years, but now buying the Pro version doesn't matter anymore. They want you to pay for a subscription. Really sucks. Normally wouldn't care and would continue to use the non-subscription service but placing a large water mark at the bottom of ...
Full Review","I feel misled. Like many others, we were promised various features that we received. Then, the dev removed those features from our accounts, which they were promised ""for a lifetime!"" Apparently, it must've been the lifetime of a fly. Very disappointing and falsely advertised. Too bad, they sent all...

I used to send individual pictures to my professor via email. Being able to use those pictures and send them as a scanned PDF has ...
Full Review","This app is easy to use and powerful. The absolute best thing about it is the interface of the cropping tool. It auto crops what it thinks is the borders of the page after you snap a pic, but leaves the crop lines up for you to manipulate. Your finger blocks the spot you're cropping, so a zoomed in ...
Full Review","I have used the CamScanner app for about 2 yrs., scanning various documents, ID or business cards, checks, photos, recipes, etc. The scan app has definitely become an essential tool used in my Real Estate business.

It's very fast and you can re-edit easily and add documents as you go, tag documents with pre-set tags or make your own tags : Woodworking, P.C. tips, Recipes etc. you c...
Full Review","Signed up for ""premium"" months ago, hardly ever use it but it had always seemed to be a solid program. Well, I opened the app a few days ago to use it, and the app performed as if I didn't have ""premium"" whatsoever. I checked through the play store to ensure that my subscription was still valid, and...
Full Review","I have used this application for a decade almost and I am happy with the application.

Full Review","Another app that changed their model and left those that purchased premium keys to be dumped on. Now, according to this company, those who paid for premium (ie supported them early on) get no acknowledgement for doing so. We kept the lights on when they started it, but they feel now it's okay to cri...
Full Review","I was completely satisfied with this application, but I was having a lot of trouble with it for a few days. Whenever I scan a file and convert it to PDF and then share it with anyone, the size of the PDF doubles. Due to which I am facing many problems. Please resolve this issue.","Wonderful resource for using your phone to fax anywhere!

Oh, and beware of fake reviews. How stupid can a person be--to copy/paste two identical reviews that sound like commercials u...
Full Review","Do yourself a favour and go read the reviews for the Camscanner (Licence) app BEFORE you download this or pay a cent to these developers. Look elsewhere for developers who want to provide you with functionality without tricking you into paying more and more and more and more. Edited to add - Google ...

Full Review","Nice appp... There is no need to arange the serial order of pictures to create PDF and it is very convinient to crop the image as per the requirement and it also provides us with a picture having such a deep clarity .. and the Best one feature is the ""Share""Option .. wecan easily send it to others ....
Full Review","Cam scanner didn't used to slap its watermark on every image. I used to love it, but now it's too restrictive and it wants to lay too much of its own credit on things like MY artwork. And it pushes for premium like a cat shows you its anus- which is to say often and unwelcome. I'm not getting premiu...
Full Review","You can use the app at all unless you are planning to pay a monthly membership fee, which you pay that annually or I believe for 6 months. Everything with free account will have watermark kn the image. I tried it for 30 minutes, removing it now because there are a lot of feee apps that do this.",I have used this app for close to 5 years and I must admit it is the best scanner I found online. The scanned material is always very clear and you can easily convert to pdf or jpeg before sending to recipients by email or Whatsapp. Saves a lot of time!,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! I've used this to send legal documents, receipts for school reimbursement, paperwork to buy 3 different properties, school work, insurance claims...cannot say enough good about how this app makes even the worst document written in pencil (my Highschooler's papers) look ama...
Full Review","This app was recommended by my realtor she failed however to mention how helpful it is for all the tons of paperwork exchanged back and forth to so many parties when closing on a home.

Did not want this and did not warn me that subcription payment or anything like this is comming up. So you guys better give my money back since Im mot even using this. Or have us...
Full Review","Superb app. Especially suitable for people who are frequently travelling or involved in site work outdoors. Its very easy to send a good copy of any document to anybody when needed. Also if the recepient needs to print the sent document, then CamScanner is a must.","Overall the app is good. But why is there no option to turn off upload to cloud if I'm logged in? It seems as if we are being forced to save data on to your servers. No matter how secure, not every document belongs to the cloud! Please add an option to turn off sync!","It is a awesome app. There is no problem in the app.If your camera quality is bad,so it is the must solution of this app.I enjoy the app very well.There is a pdf option which i use every time. It is a wastage of net but according to me it is a best app. As a result i submit 5 star in the review . So...
Full Review",I use it for all those pesky fine detailed documents that need to be legible. Also incredibly good at scanning handwritten documents on the go - no need to wrestle with a bulky scanner anymore! Never had an issue and the new update has made the interface easier to use than ever.,I have used both the free and paid versions. Both are easy to use and give great results. I especially like how easy it is to crop images. A powerful tool for anyone who needs to scan store and send single or multi page documents.,"It is such a helpful and wonderful app! The pictures all look as though they've been xeroxed, and are extremely clear and neat. It is extremely useful for certain official and professional requirements, and has several other features as well. Truly brilliant!","This is the best app I have ever used. It is so helpful with documents i have to handle, now i just take pictures and this app convert them into a beautiful PDF file for sharing. So share it with confidence and thanks to the team.","Would have given 5 stars except for how hard it was/is to get questions answered. I have 2 kids, exact same phone, both installed CS. One can scan and share to Classroom, one cannot - Classroom not even listed on sharing destinations. CS website has docs buried under news and blog and has no search ...
Full Review","I have use this app for everything. For business documents, school, work, and personal forms. To just being able to have a photo copy of something in the palm of my hand. That is a great feeling. I travel a lot and I have send a copy of my ID for a job when I was abroad.","Very easy to use with high quality reproductions. Excellent for when you need to scan/ create .pdf files, maybe out of the office,especially for an email and your only scanner option is your smartphone. Best of all.....for basics, it is 100%free!!!","Very good system specially when you're on the road traveling on the road I drive 26ft box trucks and the people that you work for he's the paperwork sent to the people that need them when you're not there in the paper work very clear very easy and actually looks like the actual paper in your hand th...
Full Review",I used to have a paid version of the app which enabled the removal of 'Scanned by Camscanner' watermark from the scanned images. Suddenly my account has turned to be a basic account and watermark has returned. As a proof I have documents stored on their cloud repository itself.,I have used this for a very long time on my the phones and I use it for business I do not like the ads but other than simple little adds it's free so I can't complain about that so I would give it all the stars that I did to honestly he dealed all about the ads but it works great.,"Cheap app... it's premium automatically and money reduced from my account Rs340 and it is auto renew every month... there is no option of unrenew.. this is creepy and I want to take further action.. bug inside in this app... hate it... just hate it... I don't want to give one simple star for this ap...
Full Review","All the features are amazing, it takes great photos. I have used CamScaner multiple times for both personal and school related things. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because of the limit of features accessible in the free version.",I just love this app. It solved my problems: I take and write many notes on a notebook and then I scan and transform the notebook into a digital one then I save it on my laptop. Practical and never failed Thank you,"Daily Task No Longer Working The Daily task which usually resets everyday, has not been working. The daily offer, which was to watch three videos, had disappeared. This was one of the best features of the app in order to get more space for files for free","Quite good. So simple and very applicable. Well smart to distinguish the main document from the surrounding parts of the taken photo. Meanwhile, you are able to define the main borders of your document.","Lifesaver for Highschool Distance Learning! My teens have enjoyed using this app to send teachers their assignments. Very easy to use, easy to share scans via email or text, scanning quality is great and the various filters are really helpful.",Very impressed with the quality and smart technology. It is so nice to be able to scan an image at an angle and have it be corrected. Color options are also great. Very happy with this app!,"Really handy, quick and easy to use. Very convenient if you haven't got a home scanner, and even quicker and less hassle than using your home scanner.","The payment setup and subscription method for this app is made to loot people, its most difficult process to cancel a subscription once you have taken it , there is no obvious method for that and you fall prey to repeated autodebit.","I always asked to sign in. I have signed in before and the suddenly signed out with no reason. When I try to type my email and passw, it said that they are wrong. I have to change my password many times and I really hate this thing. Please fix it soon .","I gave a 5 star rating when I first purchased the licence and it was worth. Now I am giving it a 1 star for the very obvious reason, and also because I don't see any response from the developers with regard to the feedback and complaints. Hurry before it's too late!","Perfect! It does what it is supposed to do and with little to no errors unlike other similar apps that have errors all the time. Well deserved, 5 stars!",I have been using this app for a few years now and It works so well and the fact you can send it as a pdf makes it very secure.. essential for me that just works off my phone for everything..,"Works well unless you take from side... but thats natural... helps detect corner of paper, straighten and auto crop it many free features especially when using school email. Very easy to use. Strongly suggest using flash and under bright light taking frop top rather than side","It is very convenient to get scanned copy in black and white or in color. Scanned copy can be converted in to jpg,pdf forms with different sizes to send mail.","It didn't have an easy way to scan multiple files and attach them together. After upload, which is a very basic feature, the unpaid version had added a ""Scanned with CamScanner"" to every page which made it unusable for official documents.","Very good except the water mark. For a casual, once in a while, user like me...do I need the watermark in the basic version to remind me I didn't pay for the app? Maybe I will look for an app without such and be grateful",I got a new update on 09.04.2020 downloaded the same and afterwards the same is not working. I am not able to use it anymore. I don't want to uninstall as my saved documents may be destroyed.,"NYC app , with amazing clarity. But I want this app to be upgraded with audio recording feature in it , so that when it comes to explanation part for the teachers it will be very helpful for them.",I used this app for years. But it became paid app. In addition monthly fee is required. I think this is little bit over priced for a scanner app. This should be one price instead of subscription. With the free resolution I cannot use anymore. I will search another option.,"It gets the job done smoothly bruh... Amazing like all my assignments are sent on time and im like so grateful for that... Especially during this time where online learning and online submitting are the thing that we depend on the most... Its crazy but having camscanner with me really helps a lot li...
Full Review",Very Bad .. App is good but the art of taking money away is very bad... I have logout from the account though they are snatching away money from my account...Can anyone suggest me what to do ? Team Camscanner can you help me in this issue or your are just here to make money ??,It's a great app I've been using it since a year and it's worked perfect for me...... it works flawlessly Never had a problem for me I do recommend this app to others just try and you will surprised with the results,This app has surprised me several times when I discovered the ability it has to turn a quick picture into a real scan. It automatically twists and transforms the image to be square and then has several nice options to crop and adjust more than just lighting.,Worst experience ever. I opted for a 3 day trial without entering my bank details. Now they have taken 340 subscription fees. I have been trying to connect with the camscanner team but even that is not happening,Great for making pictures to pdfs. Nice and fast at doing it as well. I have recommended this product in person to some people who have needed such an app.,"Just really straight forward and easy to use (free version) just take photo, set us parameters and it makes it into a pdf format, you can add signatures and things too if you need.","Really a life saver! Lots of features, easy to follow step-by-step, share button just one click away & best of all it saves a lot of my time. Thank you😍",My GM showed me this app when i was working to send things since we didnt have a fax machine. I love it cause i can send stuff to people as needed from home too since I don't have a fax machine either.,Works great for on-the-go scanning of documents. I'm a Realtor and this has been a must have for me. Images are clear and it's easy to quickly share the document.,The most useful app since... You get the point. This app saves me so much headache. It's the best and the most useful. Pay the yearly subscription and you won't regret always having access to your most needed documents.,Just downloaded and tried it for the first time. Photographed documents with CamScanner look 100% better than docs with my actual scanner. Currently using the FREE version. No complaints.
