"Honestly, I have a few issues with the app and the service, but I've been using the app almost daily for over a year, and can't give it anything but 5 stars. App is very well designed, intuitive, and isn't clunky. There are a few bugs, yes, but manageable. But something that really bugs me is that t...
Full Review","Hello, Great job by you people for adding grocery items. However, i would like to suggest you to make the list with their pictures. It is very important. Just like grofers and big basket. Becoz sometimes one cant easily remember the flavour or exact name of the item. Like there are so many flavours ...
Full Review","There's some problem with the app during payment. While payment, if I choose Gpay, it doesn't open, it directly goes to verify the payment n says 'Hold on, we are verifying the payment' and shows 'transaction failed'. If I choose BHIM, it gets stuck on Loading. Basically I can't pay n place order at...

A big shout out to customer care for being ...

Have raised to them on mail, CST, informed PMs on LinkedIn and in person, but that's okay. I think I'll be good with Zomato, because Swiggy just doesn't care enough B...

Full Review","Easy to use and track the order I wish they stop showing the ""restaurant is closed"" error before we try to make the payment. The problem may be due to huge concurrency or dirty cache reads and it is fine to encounter some times, but it is good to reduce such instances to a minimum","Editing my review..GPS tracker now works absolutely fine and even more better than that of Zomato. I've given 3 stars previously but now I've added one more start for fixing the issue. Five star only after few more restraunt options are available on the app. Zomato has covered most of my fav restaur...

Another setback of Swiggy is that i...
Full Review","As a regular user, I am loving this app for it's simple interface and ease of use. I would love to see an extended range delievery which allows me to order from within 15km, as there are some things not available nearby. In such cases ill be happy to pay extra distance fees.","The order tracking option is not working. Everytime I click on it, the app crashes and the support team is unable to understand the problem.",Randomly changes address: This app has some bug that it randomly changes address in the background if you have more than one address saved for same city.

The issue happened 3rd time for me in last 6 months.,"Awesome app for online food delivery and quality of food are very good üëç and fast delivery,there are many options of restaurants and bakery shops etc.It is easy to understand this app and I always order my food from this app and I am really enjoying with this app.","I face an issue with the payment every single time while checking out, though i ve already added my card, it never takes it, this was not the problem before, swiggy needs to fix this bug or whatever that is causing not to accept payments, it's really irritating.","Way too many bugs. The app keeps crashing randomly. Not able to go to the order tracking page. Crashes the moment you hit ""Track"". This is very frustrating.",What's wrong with you and your app guys.

Full Review",Very nice and useful app nowadays. The interference of this app is great. But their food delivery charges are very high compare to any other food delivery apps. Groceries are also available now in this app but there are also lack of good and verified grocery store in Kolkata.,"The app seems to be good. My major issue is, i am getting OTP without doing anything, for no good reason. Please fix it. At first i thought someone might have typed his/her number wrong but it is happening on daily basis, since last 4-5 days.",It's an good app but it will be easier for customers to identify the restaurant if the address of the restaurant is mentioned in it ...just the name and duration is not enough ... Restaurants with same names can create confusions,"The app help section doesnt work. Some items were unavailable, I recieved a call to go to the help section and pick another item. I recieved 4 calls and could not select another item on the app. Eventually they called and connected me on conference call with the store... very inconvenient for an app...
Full Review",Just so sad that to get the attention I had to post negative comments on Play store. Swiggy has a great service but at times the buggy software and technical errors ruin the overall experience. That said I am glad that my calls were returned.,"If i would have got stars in minus then i would have given it because it is such a useless app always showing the location unserviceable.Moreover,does not give any. Reply when having a chat at coustmer care such a useless app.""ZOMATO"" is better app than ""SWIGGY"".Waste of time","App has improved over time but ever since the covid-19 lockdown the delivery rates have skyrocketed. There should be a distance based pricing on the delivery. A price bracket must be there to set the charges accordingly.

Full Review",Swiggy appplication is so user friendly. I just love using it. The content ia enough to understand and the usability and the user experience is too good. Everything is so handy. One of those applications i love to use,"Swiggy genie was required but is not available now, not even the option is there now. That was the only thing I liked about swiggy and now it's gone.","Just add one more thing in your service application. The addtion is, give a map view to locate the restaurants near by we can see the restaurants after ordering. Fix this in my condition this is a best thing you guys can add and give a tough to competitors. #loveswiggy.","This app lets you book orders even when the restaurant denies the order and you wouldnt receive your order.

Other times, the order is placed but the app isn't updated. It will still show the same items in the cart though the restaurant has accepted the order.","Worked well in the past. With the quarantine in place though, they are charging ‚Çπ50 for delivery per order. I find this unreasonably expensive and will not use the app while this arrangement is in place.",Supporting during the Pandemic is a great thing.
