"This app is eerielly accurate! Might be one I can finally keep, without all the usual generalisations, repetitions and spiritual jargon....best app so far!! Don't know where you guys get your info or foresight but keep it up!!!","Great app i highly recommend. This one really is straightforward and there aren't any intrusive ads, it lets you do your thing.","It's a good app if you strictly want to read horoscopes, but there is so much more that could be going on in this app, like zodiac characteristics, for example.",It is very accurate. 5 stars indeed!!!,"Here we go again, I like this app a lot but prefer to have just one day at a time. Now when I try to open the app all I get is the message ""DOWNLOAD ERROR"" (and yes, I've uninstalled & reinstalled to no avail). I sent an email on Nov 29 to which I have yet to receive a reply. Guess it might be time ...
Full Review","Best horoscope app imo. I was always highly skeptical since most of the daily writings I'd seem were written poorly and extremely loose to interpretation The shorts in here are fluid, flowing and following â€” as explicit as it could get. Not to mention happening on some astonishing experiences that p...
Full Review","At first this app was amazing. However, the past few days that I have tried getting on the app it will immediately crash and say that something is wrong. I would suggest finding another horoscope app because I believe this one has finally kicked the bucket, or has too many bugs to fix.","Latest update - unable to view horoscopes, just continues to display ""try again"". This use to be the best one available. Unfortunately, now it just doesn't work. Hopefully, the bug will be fixed sooner rather then later.","Had this app for years, it's been VERY good up untill last month.. there's a BUG or the developer has ditched it. WONT LOAD or function. Disappointing. Have sent feedback and have recieved no response. Have now downloaded ""DH, Daily Horoscope"" it's just as good if not better..",I like this app but every month it takes a while to update and you miss a few days of being able to read your horoscope nearly every month. I really hope this can be fixed. Otherwise helpful and great.,this was my favorite horoscope app but for the last 2 months every time I open it itll force close. I uninstalled the app last month and just got it again to see if the problem had been fixed but it hasnt :/ I wish theyd fix the problem cause I dont really like the app I'm currently using.,Surprising how accurate it is but I've found the app is often a few days behind in its predictions.,"Latest upgrade killed the app. Was working great now its useless. The only thing that works is the damn ad!! Ads come up and even change but the horoscopes only show download error try again. Its been two weeks ,support has not replied to my email... I'm uninstalling!!",Ok so when i went into the app i put in my date of birth which was march and and i pressed continue and and it loaded and said april,Doesn't work. You enter signs for compatibility and it just resets. You pick the gender and get some random bs and it automatically assumes your gender as male first always. Even if you change it. Not very accurate either. A mess!,It's horoscope accuracy is good when compared to many other applications and sites. Kindly request you to fix the issue and relaunch the app with a fresh start and new features. Thank you,"I just loved this app but not after the last update that happened around 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't work. Even worse, there hasn't been any response from the support email address after highlighting the issue.",It's been a very ideal information to read everyday first thing in the morning. Helps a lot to make smarter decisions on a daily basis. Way to go! Job well done!!!,I read it every morning when I get up. The horoscope is only right about half the time. I enjoy reading them. I just wish they would be a little more accurate. I look forward to reading them in the future if the app will work. It has not been working the last few days.,"Worked great for two days and then suddenly anytime I try to pull up my daily horoscope it just says ""download error, try again"" that's all it's been showing for about 3 days :/","At first, the predictings were okay. Then it got to a point it started showing download error. Pls fix this problem as soon as possible.",This app hasn't worked properly since the last update. You can't even open it. I've tried over and over again everyday. Can't believe the people who run this website don't check their own app.,"It hasn't worked for months now, it says error... Even after deleting and downloading it again. It's sad, I liked the app ;(","Shame zero stars not an option, not available try again, the only thing that reloads is the annoying ads, no horoscope available at, all but the damn add have no trouble. Ap is complete garbage and a waste of time. Zero use",Please fix. Keeps crashing and now it won't even open. Loved the app before it started having issues.,"I used to love this app but for whatever reason, the last update killed it. It crashes constantly. :/",Used to be a good app for years. For the last year or so it has been buggy. Now it doesn't work at all. Uninstalling.,"Good if your into this type stuff but me personally I've looked at this along with 5 other apps and 5 other websites and everyone says something different about pretty much everything... Daily horoscopes, love compatibility yada yada yada lol therefore I don't believe any of this BS, but have at it....
Full Review",Love it but can't access it anymore...download error . Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but it didn't help.,Though the app was working v well previously and should be rated higher current experience has been not so good and the app is not working at all even after reinstalling,The last upgrade shut down the app and says download error. Deleted. This used to be a great app.,"loved the app until the new update, now does not work, freezes will not move past home screen Update: 12/17 Has not worked in weeks, keeps saying download error","Was great for a long while! Lately hasn't worked even after updates, always says can't load try again.","Worst app. It took my DOB and then crashed. Restarted application more than 10 times, yet it crashes.","Look i love this app its so on point w my day to day but every now and again you guys just go off the map and all i get is ""download error try again"" i haven't gotten to read my horoscope in a week +",App is unable to upload. Missing it for over a month. Please check and restore .,"Ads break the program. Lame. They consider the sign changes and read too much into them, but ignore the aspects occurring. Poor interpretations.","Not working for several weeks now. App shuts down as soon as opened, no content loads at all.","Whenever I try to enter it, it never loads for my zodiac, so it's only useful for compatibility and switching your zodiac.","Was good not anymore. I loved this app used it every day but since last update it just wont load states download error, have reinstalled no joy :(","Keeps saying it won't download, try again...but I have perfect signal for it. Uninstalled...",It wont show me anything but 'download error'. This used to be my farvorite app. Now it sucks.,"The app is good, but never goes off on time. 10 AM means 10 AM, not when you feel like it. Get with the program already!!",Ay so I just downloaded it and I couldn't even do anything on it. IT SAID THERE WAS A ERROR IN DOWNLOADING. WHEN YOU GO TO THE PAGE. AND I TRYED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND IT STAYED THE SAME.,"Only part that works is compatibility. Been having ""download error"" message since it was installed",Today I m very disappointed with d app bcoz for November it was working very nicely but for December it is not showing anything very bad,"This app continuously crashes, can't even open it for 1 second before it crashes","Doesn't work. As soon as I open the app, it says download error, try again.",Compabillity works out fine but it usually kicks me out or says error pls try again so in my opinion I would find a different app,"Pretty boring,& generic better than nothing##ðŸ¤¤",App is dead and will not update content. Tried for 3 weeks.,After i input my birthday the app crashes regularly. Great app very useful!,App will not load....I keep trying and norhing changes.....I've uninstalled and re-installed and still nothing.,Was great until it stopped working for me which was very disappointing.,"Installed, uninstalled this app 3 time. Galaxy s8. After you enter your birthday date it says download error try again. DELETED!",Now days its troubling..not at all able to see anything.App is not opening.,Its show only download error try again. Its not working.,"Since the last update it wont load at all. I dont want to uninstall this app, i just want it to start working again..",It won't even load anymore. I have used this app for years. What a major disappointment,Not working not opening at all. Crashing while opening,I use to like this app. Until it started closing or keeps stopping,"It's not working. Keeps saying download error, try again",Before update it good but after update it's bad and it's not working,This is my favorite app but it stopped working few months back ðŸ˜­ just says can't load,After installing so many times it shows download error try again after opening the app,"Downloaded.. Said download error.. Try again.. Never loaded, about to uninstall.",The app keeps shutting down on its own and it won't let me use it.,Worked good for yeats but getting download errors will not work for the last eeek.,Bad. It says download error try again every time.,"App is not working at all, it showing download error..",Says download error for every zodiac sign. Unusable. Redmi note 7.,Latley it hasnt been working but i would of give it five star i really like how details the messages are,Use to work for me now all I get is error try again.,Latest upgrade broke the app please try and fix it.,Was great but just says error with app and won't open,It doesn't want to work; wouldn't get the internet and then kick me out of this app...,I get it two stars because app doesnt give you anything else about your zodiac sign just the daily horoscope.,"Accurate, very talented and well constructed","This is a app, I will recommend it to anyone, if they can add a yearly reading","Hasn't worked in a couple weeks. Too bad too, I like it for a long time."
