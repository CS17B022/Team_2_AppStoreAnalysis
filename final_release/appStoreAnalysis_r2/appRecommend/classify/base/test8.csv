"I absolutely love this app, I have found and used a lot of useful pins for my house, pool & deck. I have also found some great recipes. Some were delicious and I have made several times & some didn't live up to the hype. I love trying out new recipes even if they don't taste good to me. Great app, I...

Full Review","Pin has been very kind and generous with time by guiding me slowly through their product, helping me become educated in the various opportunities, and presenting me with ideas and tools so that I can implement as I see fit.

Full Review","I love this app! It's so addictive because there's always something interesting available so I'm on it at least once a day. From DIY Projects and cooking hacks to fantastic art and nerdy posts about all of my favorite books and shows that are just endlessly entertaining and inspiring! It brightens m...

When this element is reverted to its previous form without the shrinking to fit in frames with text blocks under it, my rating will return to five stars E...
Full Review","I can find literally everything with this app, I use it constantly. I absolutely love it for exploring new recipes, diy projects, hobbies, well, actually, exploring it all. So many things that I have never seen or had or thought of, etc. & I am sure there is still thousands upon thousands of things ...
Full Review","I really enjoy it, but its frustrating that it doesnt want to swipe at times. I would also give it five stars if it didnt give so many picrures in other languages. And if i accidentally click on one it just gives more in other languages. Otherwise its really amazing.","It's even pathetic now; as it get slower to load, while I can update the app in merely within seconds!!

I don't like that the search option doesn't always come up when I need it but barely an inconvenience. I also love the ability to change my notifications.,"The select function is working fine, although it can't select to download image just to share. Kind of a bummer!

I am never disappointed. There's something for everyone, from foodies to Crafters, collectors and the world is bizarre entertainment!","I like the app and the content it provides but there are two things that tick me off: One.

Full Review","While it's all fine and good to get lost down that rabbit hole that is Pinterest, the pins that come with auto playing music are annoying. What's up with that?

Full Review","Getting to find new things you've never seen, heard of or tried before is so interesting and I love Pinterest for it. However, it is glitchy and the ads are awful.

Full Review","This has been a great app to have...I just love Pinterest and everyone who pins on it. Good people with such creativity and talent. Also it is such a great marketing tool to have handy. Whenever I get new inventory in for my online shop, I will pin some pics to let people know what I have available....
Full Review",I was very happy with Pinterest and really enjoyed but over the last 2 weeks I can not access any of the recipes. There is no longer a link to do that. Very very very disappointed! If it is not fixed soon I'll take this app off!,"Hi, I hope you're fine. Actually, I love this app a lot, but recently, when I open it none of the photos or videos are visible.

Full Review","I absolutely love pinterest as it's the easiest place to get inspiration for just about ANYTHING. If there were a premium ad-free version I'd happily pay for it.
