"There needs to be a change to some features, it's bothering me so much that I can't see who viewed my stories on my archives/highlights after 24 hours. It used to be doable some time ago, but y'all took it away, for what? Second, There's gotta be a feature to add AND remove pictures to a slide post....

During a video call, there may be points in time where if one or more people have their camera on, there will no longer be audio, and even after several hangups, it will do the same thing until eventually it just goes away.

Full Review","Overall a good app. The only problem is it's laggy, and the multiple pictures posted together have to be cropped. I think a good feature is to atleast allow the cropping to have more options, not just a square ratio. For example, If I post three vertical pictures that are of the same size, I can jus...

Full Review","Dark mode is terrible on Instagram. Just my personal opinion, but I think Instagram looks better with a white background. Maybe instead of a pitch black background, it should be dark gray. I know it's system wide, but you guys need to figure out a way to toggle dark mode on/off within the app, even ...

Full Review","Way too many bugs and no due diligence done on comment reporting. When an account is growing too fast for some people then they report your account despite the growth being 100% organic - one would think Instagram would put a human touch behind the app, but I guess it's Facebook 2.0.","Used for years without much trouble until today.

Full Review","Look, it's not a bad app and it can be enjoyable to use. But my main issue is that it automatically crops your photos due to limited sizing(not a problem on Twitter btw).

Full Review","This app allows me to communicate with friends and post the highlights of my life so I can look back at it, and it allows me to just update how I'm feeling that day or my 'story' of the hour which is really refreshing thanks to COVID-19 I'm now using it constantly. This app also allows me to search ...
Full Review","4.5. Easy and fun to use, fun to keep track of other people, but I wish it was more apparent when you need to get an update.

Full Review","It's a great app for sharing etc but the algorithm sucks. People's accounts can't grow and now only 10% of your followers can see your posts.
