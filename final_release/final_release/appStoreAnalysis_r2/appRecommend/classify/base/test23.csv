"Not sure if an update broke Google voice. Whenever I ask Google to take me to a location, it says it hasn't learned it. Yet when I type in an address Google maps works fine. I use voice because I'm a taxi. And it's very useful to remain hands-free while driving. Not sure if this is related to the ap...
Full Review","I think its a great app but have had issues recently which is a shame! The compass is messed seriously messed up on android! (tried to do the same thing on another android phone and had the same result as on my regular phone) Basically, when I go to go for a walk, the arrow is never pointing in the ...
Full Review","I rely on this app more than any other. It's great for navigation, but also stores hundreds of pins for me including places I love and places I want to go. I have them separated in lists by category, although I really wish I could color code the pins in each list to tell what category each of them a...
Full Review","I had the exact same problem as another reviewer with my Maps app crashing upon opening. I was able to fix the problem by going to app manager in settings and upgrading the application to a newer version without rolling the app back to the factory version which I do not recommend. Hope this helps ot...

Full Review","So stupid I can't use offline maps now because, I merge my SD card with my internal memory, now Google maps says there's no SD card installed, even though Android clearly says so, the 32 gigs of internal memory has been paired with 128 gig SD. The phone says there was one pool of 160GBs, on two stor...

I rolled back to the ""factory"" version which by comparison is significantly inferior. I tried to update but it hangs ""waitung for download."" I've tried almost every ""fix"" on the...
Full Review","This app was very good, but in August that changed. It used to tell you where and when to turn at the bottom, but now it displays it on the map. If your destination is on the upper left of the map and you are driving, you have to use your finger and move the map, which is not legal in California. Th...

Also doent list street names like before either, I have to follow the street for a bit to see the name. I've read the article that you keep telli...
Full Review","Overall it works well and has lots of info for places. The worst part is the default into walk mode. Since I use it to deliver products by driving, walk mode is not an option. The feature for one click directions is useless because of this default. It takes so many touches to navigate because you ha...

This almost left me stranded, as well as the personnel I was supposed to be pic...
Full Review","Why does Google add features and then remove them a few updates later? Used to tell you which platform your train is on now it no longer does. Why? Also the time when next train is no longer working the way it should. When I try to open next train it just shows the current train instead of other one...
Full Review","Had a recent issue of the app freezing when selecting certain locations (mainly resteraunts.) and requiring a hard reset, both me and my partners phone, entirely different models. Hope to see an update soon! Update - I appreciate the tech support, but I have already done all steps I can on my side. ...
Full Review","Reply to developer response: I'm afraid the article you recommended wasn't helpful. I already have High Accuracy enabled. Furthermore, the figure 8 method of calibrating the compass doesn't work, no matter how many times I try it. That said, Waze had no trouble locating me. The app is now having dif...

We have all done the basic troubleshooting. Edit: I have factory reset my phone and had the same issues. The forums are full of complaint...
Full Review","Everyone looking for the Start Driving feature, it's now stupidly hidden in a widget that you have to add to your homescreen, there is no longer any way to get to it from the app. Hi, thanks for the response, but that's not an acceptable option, besides being silly, Google Assistant won't use my mic...
Full Review","Since the most recent OS update this app is basically worthless. Constantly showing my location 1 mile away or more and skipping all over the map. I might as well go back to foldable maps in my car. It also affects my running app. Apparently I can now run across water and 10 miles is 20 minutes. I'v...
Full Review","The app is fine unless there's a gravel road or laneway it can choose. Then it chooses to take me to a gravel road and to the back alleyway of city addresses. There seems to be no way to fix this in the app, often it won't allow you to even manually choose a different road. I've been misdirected man...

Full Review","Whatever the update was for Android a couple days ago has a serious flaw. The GPS accuracy is about 500+ yards off, rerouting you every trip. I have to use either Google maps or Waze for my business and it is affecting accuracy and timing for myself and my customers. Uninstalled app, cleared cache, ...
Full Review","The new update ruined navigation. This app was my go to gps. I made the mistake of updating and the last time I tried using it, I had to restart the app multiple times to find my location. Today I tried navigating to a super market 20 minutes away and couldn't get the app to track my location, it wo...
Full Review","This app has been glitching for two months now! It is unable to see where I'm located, it takes me to the wrong places, it wastes my time switching to roads I'm not even on. It is unable to work when I'm on unknown roads and its reaction time is literally as if i was reading a physical map in traffi...
Full Review","Used to be good until the update completely broke the app. I'm on a pixel 3 as well, so if it's this screwed up on Google software, I can't imagine it's any better on other android phones... It will constantly freeze and crash. It's forced my phone to shut down twice, and freezes and constantly need...
Full Review","Give us OPTIONS, not take things away. I know it's a free program but maybe you'll take some constructive feedback. Taking the compass away during navigation?!? That's a very useful feature. At least give us the option to turn it back on. It also keeps asking me to put in my work address for commute...
Full Review","Currently GPS location is messed up by 1000 ft to miles. Ive cleared cache, data, restarted phone, turned the gps on and off with zero luck. The only time I get an accurate reading is at home next to my window and connected to my home wifi. This has effected and service that uses maps. Google maps g...
Full Review","This app never knows my location and constantly spins in circles. It will tell me to make U-Turns over and over because it has no clue where I am going. While the location was lost and spinning, it thought I was going 145-150 mph (in the corner where it tells the speed) when I was at a red light. Th...
Full Review","This used to work flawlessly. Now, for whatever reason, I keep losing my GPS signal and it won't come back unless I exit out and restart my navigation. Your copy and paste response to everyone here doesnt help and had nothing to do with the issue. I don't know what's happening. But it's frustrating ...
Full Review","Since last updates maps is giving weird ass directions on back roads, side streets, and even through my local community college with 20 million speed bumps. It's slow to start up now, slow to show the direction you need to turn when you first start navigating, it isn't showing the street names I nee...

This problem needs to be fixed asap. Even after I update the app 3-4 times a days it still doesn't work. I even delete t...
Full Review","Maps has been working great up until today when it would not open. Tried a few things with the phone, eventually downloaded update. Maps no longer gives audible directions when the phone is locked. It means I need to pull over more frequently and open the phone to get directions. I don't like leavin...
Full Review","Who cares about an icon? How about an update that actually fixes something. Example: Fix the map so it actually follows my position while moving, instead of showing my position 30mi back - It constantly does that. Sometimes it says it's searching for GPS signal, other times it doesn't.. Never works ...
Full Review","This app will not work anymore. I used this app on a daily basis, and one day it just quit working. I do not get an arrow anymore when I try to use it, just a dot, if I do get an arrow it doesn't move. The ETA time updates to show I'm not moving, when in fact I'm driving down the road. I've checked ...
Full Review","The new update, which requests feedback after every trip, has absolutely ruined my experience with Google Maps. I am a private contractor and am signed into Google maps for at least 4 hours a day. I often must exit out of a route in order to see the birds eye view and orient myself while driving. Th...

Full Review","Update: Google stated comments would be forwarded to the appropriate team at Google to address. To date have not heard back with a REAL solution. With the number of negative reviews stating the same issue(s), I would think Google would want to provide a fix. A great product about a year ago is just ...
Full Review","I originally reported that the update was causing an inaccurate blue dot reading. To fix the issue, I had to delete the phone back to manufacture settings and then redid all the updates. Now the GPS location is reading it accurately. I don't know if the last maps update caused the issue or the phone...
Full Review","This app would be perfect if they'd just fix 2 things... Stop taking me down back roads, dirt roads, narrow cramped streets, and the like! When they're is far easier routes, highways, wide open main roads! Put the option in there for me to PREFER highways!!!!!!!! The other problem, when going to an ...
Full Review","Update: all this article is telling me is how maps works (which I already understand how it works) and to restart my phone and ensure the calibration is set up. Am I the only one experiences constant drops in connectivity to maps?? Literally mid route it just says ""searching for GPS"" and continues o...
Full Review","Its great app, specially being free. I could suggest a few fixes. #1 The speedometer feature is s great adition, however, it kind of has its own brain as to when to display in kph or mph. I have it set to mph but whenever it wants it shows in kph. #2 Can this feature work separated from the map sett...

Full Review","I've been using Google Maps for years and everything's been in the same place. For some reason you guys decided to move everything around on an app that we use while we drive. This makes absolutely no sense. This is a stupid decision just leave the app alone. And where is driving mode? I can't find ...
Full Review","Used to love Google Maps for traveling and planning trips and tagging locations to visit or places visited.

I can be following the route and then all of a sudden it shows im half a block over and all i get is rerouted over and over to get ...
Full Review","This app continues to disappoint as our home address is not even close to where it is supposed to be (mile down the road). Really annoying having to drop a pin to multiple people for events and such and having goods/services delivered that cant find the house. Change the city in the address line and...
Full Review","I like the detailed route data and real time route adjustment. When traffic piles up, it's easy to reroute and the timing seems just about right. I wish the lane by lane navigation was more detailed like Apple Maps new update. In a congested interstate system, I find myself looking at the navigation...
Full Review","Not sure what your developers have done but Google Maps is no longer pinpointing my location! The only way I can work around this is turn hit the ""X"" & then enter (the address I am trying to get to is still showing on the screen)!

Full Review","Old review: ""Can't yet speak for the map navigation, but this launches very fast, which is great."" Then an update's available, today. But Google doesn't describe what that update *does.* So what changes were made? I don't want the speed which the last update gave to be taken away by this one. And I ...

Full Review","This is ridiculous. It use to work perfectly! Now...., it's just horrible. Works great after i uninstalled the latest update. Fix your update and return to greatness. I lose GPS signal and the app gets all goofy with the update. Am I missing something? Like I said, works great without the update.","Too many parameters and you are loosing the point for the most important. Get to destination safe. No injuries, no police tickets.
