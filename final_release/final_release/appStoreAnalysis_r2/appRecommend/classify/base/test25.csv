"Lots of cheating played in this game. It's a good game but when I see the cheatings I really hate to uninstall it. I have done it so many times when it frustrate me while playing. I have recorded screen plays which is the evidence I have. Opponents open and pass directly from home to pass, how is it...
Full Review","Disappointed. There is a set pattern. The algorithm always tries to make it a close finish. Definitely a scripted game. I must add. If you are at an advantage by virtue of playing intelligently but the opponent has only one token left, you can be pretty sure he will quickly move towards the house..6...
Full Review","I absolutely hate, with a passion, how biased this game is. It's no where near random. Because the opponent with ALWAYS get the right number to get me out!!! And it is very frustrating... I'm always losing when it comes to the missions... It's really pathetic. I don't care how many times you're goin...
Full Review","Don't know what's wrong with the game's algorithm. Winner is pre-decided , whatever you do nothing can stop the decided to win. Every time you roll, it is going to be captured. Sometimes its frustrating. I read many more comments and the same problem is with thousands of others. Do something with th...
Full Review","Ludo is originally a game of luck. But, not this game. It's a fixed game. To make the games interesting, the developers have some fixed set of rules. Let no one win so easily and no one lose so easily. It's very easy to get the required number for the opposition team, once your piece is in definite ...
Full Review","This is the WORST app ever!!!! I freakin' lost 13 games continuously ðŸ˜  The older version of ludo king was much better, but now I literally don't understand what the hell is wrong with this game! If I had a choice, I would have given it 0 stars, not because I lost continuously, but because something...
Full Review","Worst game ever, the game has been fixed by the developers, most of the time they keep you in game even you 3 piece is in home, and the last one need only 1'number. No possibility you will win or not. Last piece kicked off by every player. If you are going to be become no. 1 , but wait what you see,...
Full Review","There are so many things wrong with this game, first, if you need one to win, the game is designed in such a way, it will always show a bigger number and if you are near opponent's else's starting point, the game will definitely will show numer that will make us loose a token, like this whole game i...
Full Review","I was enjoying this game for last couple of days and it was fantastic until I saw in recent game where my dice and game controlled by app itself. I don't know whether it was hacked or any other problems but my game was out of control and seemed someone else has control. This was a quite shocking exp...
Full Review","For a game that is based on luck, they sure have pulled a number with this one. If you donâ€™t believe me, just see for yourself- for every game you play, the last 2, sometimes 3, tokens always end up neck to neck. If one of them is way ahead, they start getting smaller or unplayable numbers on the dr...
Full Review","Worst gameplay, game is designed to take more and more time to play. The dice is not fair, it works a way if a player is winning it automatically goes against him and you'll get beated. Seeing this you'll get irritated. Not a fair game at all and also consumes so much battery power. I wish there was...
Full Review","Dice is rigged. Very frustrating. It works on patterns so as to make games close finishes. This can be ok for regular games, but don't ever try to complete any of 'missions' to unlock new themes. The 'popular' mode is a scam. It will end up wasting your time feeling frustrated. I played 15 games tod...
Full Review","This game is just sooo rigged. You may say the number on the dice is random but it just is not. Even a toddler could make out the difference. The people always just get the perfect number that they desire. It's not once, twice, thrice or 4 times, it's just always. Trust me, this is tooo good to be a...
Full Review","I don't understand what was going on. If my opponents has a crown or highest points the game should be in their hands . The computer has always put them into the safe zone . Is there any possible when all the tokens continuously killed when they reached their end it is possible only in this game . A...
Full Review","This game is good , but If you are going to win they will show that your internet connection is not working . And if it is working they will give the opponent the exact number they want , either if they giving or they are hacking this game as this game can be easily hacked . I have Played many games...
Full Review","Very poor. Most of the time it shows as under maintenance. Now I need to search another option instead of this. I faced the above problem once again today. It again shows under maintenance. The game developers need to work hard on this problem. The above problem I faces everyday.now this is very ser...
Full Review","It's fun and competitive when playing with friends... however, whatever ""random"" dice generator they have programmed feels incredibly cheap and bias and in favour of your opponent, even if it is random, it certainly doesn't feel like it. It's hard to explain but it definitely feels unfair and lookin...
Full Review","Love the game ! But the dice numbers are not random, which does not give you a natural ludo playing experience. 1) The first 6 no. doesn't come up untill a certain opponent is near your starting point. 2) 90% of the time a person gets the perfect no. to kill. 3) If a person is left out while others ...
Full Review","The worst dice algorithm ever!!! The machine sets the winner in the online version and showers that player with 6s. Like seriously?? Even while playing with the computer, it just happens to roll all 6s and just the right number for the computer to kill the opponent! Very convenient and freaking nons...
Full Review","This game would be SO much better if the dice roll was actually random. As others have mentioned there is clearly a set algorithm and you can more or less tell at the start of the game if you're going to win or not. I've also noticed some players seem to somehow get double rolls without rolling a 6 ...
Full Review","The dice is purely biased. I don't get the numbers I want to capture my opponent's token. And in fact i am the one whose tokens get captured each and every time. Its been 10 games and this still continues. The dice is not randomised at all. If your 3 tokens get into the house and u just need 1 to wi...
Full Review","I am uninstalling this game. This game is broken always have issues. I have faces glitch many times. And it seems they have fixed the pattern of the dice. When your token or other player token is there, your dice will always get that number so you can kill his token. Game should be unpredictable and...
Full Review","Sometimes I lost my internet connection, and then I have to close and restart the game. This is happen not only in once time, but more and more until my stars power empty. When play with four player, just only one player can play with normal playing without lost the power. When this player have roll...
Full Review","Dear Developer, I have a question for you. Why can't you put random number algorithm in this game. Whenever I come close to my opponent, I eat from him. This shows that if you get close to the opponent, you are sure to eat. Sorry, but it's not interesting, instead it depresses me to my core and demo...
Full Review","It is a fraud game. The player with high number of coins or higher in level always wins. The loser always gets lower number on dice throws while the winner gets 6-6-5 most of the times. Dice is biased. Rather it is based on algorithm. There is no strategy you can use of your own. If you do all your ...
Full Review","I have played this game many times. And i have understood that the makers have made the algorithm to attract more players. Newer the player, more the dice favours the player. The developers have killed the essence of the game..which is lucky roll. No longer there is any luck involved in this game. A...
Full Review","Rigged algorithms! I think they favour those who make a purchase in the game and remove ads. And for those who don't, they rig the game and never let them win. In this way we will lose all coins and eventually have to buy coins in the game. That is their strategy. Well i am not gonna spend money buy...

There is a bug in game , if you play multiplayer game suddenly your connectivity is interrupted and next you are not able to play. And game is end and you are lost the g...
Full Review","I've seen many reviews mentioning about the biased nature of dice & pre determined outcomes after few games. I find them true from my experience also. However, I wud like to point out the nonsense thing called as ""Diamonds"". You can undo/ keep rolling the dice so that you get what suits you as long ...
Full Review","In the beginning it was working just fine but now a days it mostly shows no internet/ slow internet, whereas that's not the case at all. I'm able to play on Yalla Ludo app with the same internet speed. I lost 4 games today because of the same. It's surely the app which is going through some trouble....
Full Review","Such a poor game. Very poor algorithm used. Why I am not able to get three sixes continuously?? Why I never got the chance to keep my ""goti on same place other than stopages??? Why every time I can be sure to win the game or lose it after some chances???? It is just a time pass game but much far awa...

Full Review","This game graphics are good..but it seems totally scripted , the rolling disc is not random at all. All decides when you play online. Doesn't matter how fast you reaches in victory point, the game will always end with the same situation, where you require one to win ðŸŽ² so much disappointment going t...
Full Review","The game is good and all. The interface is also good. But the game sucks in its predictive dice value. It's not at all random. It occurs seeing the dice value of other players and tends to match it likewise. For eg. if I get a six, my opponent is bound to get a six in the next two turns. This is whe...
Full Review","They are lucky that there is no option for Zero star. Once i have started a game of 50000. It didnâ€™t find any opposition. Later on i find coins are gone. Game of Injustice . But it also has a serious drawback. Sometimes it gives undue benefits to someone. Sometimes it is seen that opponent is gettin...
Full Review","The app itself is good but the dice is completely rigged. It gives your or others exactly what you need to kill someone else and say red is almost home and yellow is far behind, it consistently gives yellow high rolls. Those are just two examples. People say it's random but, as a ludo player all my ...
Full Review","Cannot be a fair game since the dice is based on a computer algorithm. I have noticed it many times it works according to the situation. If the user is about to win then it will give those numbers only which will make him win or if the user's level is beyond yours then it will always flip to his fav...

And while opening advertisement for collecting coins also this problem happens . If this ...
Full Review","Worst app you will ever see. Even if I roll the dice 25-30 times I can't get 1. Nowadays even opponents get 1 easily to win when they roll the dice. Also I won't get the number I want to him opponent player. But most of the time they will get the number to hit me. It happens in 2 players, 4 players ...
Full Review","I liked this game. But yes, as everyone said, this game break the rules of probability. When you are in outer circle, chances of you getting 1-2 is more than the 6. And once you enter the inner line and need just 1 or 2, suddenly chances of getting 6 are more than chances of getting 1-2. How? Now un...
Full Review","It is the worst game I ever played. If I could have choice to give rating in minus I could give it. It can cause you a kind of depression. Most of the time when played this game if I was in need of 2 it will give me 6 or any other no. If opponent's have 2 dice remaining and I want only 1 to win the ...
Full Review","I don't have an iota of doubt that this Ludo King is totally biased game. No randomness at all. Dice favours the player who has spent money 80% of time. Opponent gets what they exactly need almost everytime. No surprise if I get 1 three times in a row. Its normal. And opponent getting 6s successivel...
Full Review","I like this game, but my last play was completely malicious, my moves were reversed and done by someone else. Not one time the complete game the same thing was happened, finally I quit myself. I don't know wheather my opponent controlled my moves or it's a bug(mostly not because it happened only for...
Full Review","The idiot of a developer here has serious issues in understanding random number generation process. So, here I waited for 25 trials till getting a 1. Take a calculator and do the basic probability, it's 1%, far below 16.67% (assuming iid, uniform distribution, trials). Such a sloppy implementation. ...
Full Review","Random number generator is rigged. Keeps continuously giving 6 to opponent. And you play the whole game on only 1. Trust me I have played game with only 1. And also when you are about to kill opponent, the opponent gets 6,6,5 and gets away. This happens every time. This game is rigged and doesn't ge...

Full Review","Dice doesn't give random value. Fully biased game. Winner is fixed from the starting. I think most of the users have faced the same issue and reported this but the developer team is not worried about making the dice random rather than earning money from ads. You might earn money from ads but make th...
Full Review","Very Good Game but... There is an issue of no internet connection while my internet stays fine. My device is also fine to play this game:â€” Redmi Note 5 Pro (6GB RAM & 64GB Storage).

Full Review","Tokens u play with are oversized for no good reason. They cover the square in front so sometimes it can be hard to count squares correctly & if two tokens are next to each other u can end up moving the token u didn't intend to move. Mission has bugs.

Full Review","The game sucks because the dies are not random. So many times you can see the game will conveniently give a player the perfect roll to even the playfield. That is a garbage strategy because instead of getting the feeling of luck, you feel that you are playing a rigged game. Why not have a purely ran...
Full Review","Most biased and stupid game ever. The developers have no idea about gaming algorithm. Winner is always predicted. Even when one someone is winning, the opponents deliberately obtain better numbers and the winner becomes the loser. No strategy can be applied here. In sum up, worst game ever and this ...

On a several occasions I've played, I was 100% due to win and only one counter left, while the other players have 4, they still manage to win! How absolutely ridiculous! I'm very angry with this game. Complete set up and all fixed! I wouldn't ...
Full Review","Earlier the game was good....then they started updating , the dice rolling algorithm is not proper and i think they are favouring who buy coins for cash. If you win 1-2 games next must loose, thats the way they set. And as other lots of people mentioned. You have all 3 dice home and only 1 left and ...
Full Review","This game is good but only thing is when we need any number than it will not roll only. Till the opponent reaches at the end at that time only the number will come.

Full Review","A very complicated game. Actually, the game is overall cool, but the strategy of the computerised dice is not understandable.

Worst part is you feel cheated repeatedly and you are helpless because there is nobody to hear you out except the victims as y...
Full Review","Horrible application of the concept of probability. This game is so flawed. There is always a person who gets a lot of 6 and one who gets very less.
