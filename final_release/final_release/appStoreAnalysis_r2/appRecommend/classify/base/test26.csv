"The game is great but the developers should be more concerned about making the game better instead of finding ways to grab money. I had uninstalled this game a month ago because of the problems it had. And reinstalled it a few days ago hoping that they might've fixed it. But no, it's all the same, I...
Full Review","Really great fun, I like the competitive fighting that goes on and how there are so many modes to pick from. Would recommend this game for anyone. There are a few bugs though that could be fixed like the Mic issue. Whenever I try to talk to my friends it will bug out and not let me talk to them. But...
Full Review","It is a good game. I just started playing this game 2 or 3 weeks back and I am experiencing lots of issues like glitch, lagging and ping issues. I am frustrated with this game just within 2 weeks. Most of the times when we play with friends we face voice chat troubles, the mic stop working we are no...
Full Review","First of all you created a very good game here, but I think the permanent clan membership option shouldn't be available until the player has been in the game for at least three seasons allowing them to decide which clan to join.

Full Review","It's a really enjoyable and competitive game, especially with friends. But it's a shame that the developers can't deal with cheaters, lagging, bugs, etc. They are more focused on making new skins, on wich players are spending lots and lots of money and can't even experience a good gameplay. In the R...
Full Review","The game is good overall, thrilling and exciting game. I am playing this game since last 2 years from starting to present and I have seen a lot of changes in the game. The game is gr8.

In every match I couldn't speak with my mic. I have to close the game and restart it again and also my phone is slow so while I open the game it l...
Full Review","I love the game. No matter how much i've played it still good. But im giving it 2 stars just because of the bugs that is in the game in this specific update. The game freezes mid-game, sometimes it just freezes while im fighting with another team. I had to reopen the app and lost my communication wi...

Please do not reply stating its my network issue. I have a solid internet connection and other apps work fine without ...
Full Review","This game is supposed to be fun but still, there are bugs in the game. I tried the customer support in-game but the recommended solutions won't work. Also, there is a certain bug in the game that whenever I land on the apartments on the school in the Erangel map, the game just decides to float me up...

Full Review","I've been playing this game for 2 years now. It has its ups and downs. The developers constantly keep improving it.

Full Review","The mic glitches are so random and annoying. Suddenly the microphone stops working. The game crashes more times than previously it used to. And it's not device issue or memory issue. I play it on OnePlus 6 and it doesn't have memory issue or RAM issue. Daily I have to restart my game 2-3 times out o...
Full Review","I've been playing this game since its inception, and I have to say, it has always had problems. Terrible lagging at the worst possible times in the middle of gun fights, gliches within the map design, easily hacked by an extraordinary large number of players. It use to sort of be a fun game but the ...
Full Review","How ironic this is called mobile game but not good for mobile data connection. I'm using full signal LTE connection but still can't play well 'cause it freezes from time to time. It says Asia server has 48ms ping, but in-game it becomes 250-400ms. I play this game on steam and I love it. Sadly, this...

Full Review","As a regular player of the game I want to address the most frustrating issues in the game: Ranked Arena - Most likely due to latency but sometimes when being shot at and you duck for cover, some hits only register a few seconds after, no matter where you are on the map at that point, leading to some...

I have a POCO F1 mobile with high speed internet facility but there is a soo much of game lagging since I have Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. How did u explain about that. For this worst experience I had spend my money to ge...
Full Review","Was the best game. But since the last 3 seasons lagging is getting way out of control. I smashed brand new P30 Pro out of frustration because lagging and loading is causing us to struggle with game play. Please sort out your servers and ping issues rather than adding new features and skins and what ...

PubG is a good realistic game.Pubg is the best game I've ever played.The updates are fun when they add new modes.(Edit) I love the game and all but I recently got my new phone Samsung Galaxy A20 and I just instal...
Full Review","I am literally so obsessed with this shooting game! Not as realistic as the pc version, of course (although with the recent update its definitely getting there!), but the graphics can be amazing with the right phone. There are some glitches, but they don't occur that often for me, and I can't recall...

Overall its great, but can yall not do wacky fortnite-ish things like a dog wearing a hoodie suit and.

Full Review","Two days ago there was an update. My friends got 2 free crates. Lucky me! I got nothing. Someone explain this to me. Also the game is totally unstable and it freezes every time. After 2 years of playing this game and buying the royal pass i can say that im really losing interest in this game. Last t...
Full Review","The constant quick chats on the new update and the foreign players are enough to make me uninstall this game after having it for over 3 years. Good job ten cent. How much more toxic can you make this game. Guys jumps 3000 meters away from me, quick chats marked a location that stays up for 4 seconds...
Full Review","This game's BROKEN not because of the gameplay but because of the players , nowadays I always either find players that teams up in solo match(I can confirm this because they were speaking through mic) or players that kill their own teammates. Don't Even Bother Reporting Either ,of all the people I'v...
Full Review","Gameplay etc is good but the game has a lot of bugs, like a lot. There's no way you'll play this game without a bug. Like in my case, the character starts moving on it's own and I have no control over it. Also sometimes when I open the scope, it'll not move and freeze at a single place. And when I t...
Full Review","Full of bugs and glitches. It has become really hard to play the game because of high ping problems and lags. The developer is very active when it comes to adding new content in the game but the enthusiasm in fixing bugs and glitches is always seen to be missing. You will continue to loss your users...
Full Review","This game is awesome, I've been playing this game since season 2, but it been getting worse ever since the new updates the maps are glitched out. The buildings are blurry and take within 15 seconds to load properly. When I land I don't roll, I just lean forward. Within 15 seconds I end up rolling, t...
Full Review","Definitely love this game. I like how i was able to ease into the game unlike some other games out there. Ive read a few negative comments, and all i have to say is I havent had any trouble. Players need to know that they have to have a good signal to play this game. Dont blame PubG, blame your serv...
Full Review","no doubt, it is an excellent game. but after the new season arrived, the game is lagging a lot. Whenever the enemy comes nearer to me, instead of firing at him It fires in the air or on my teammates. And also sometimes the mike automatically gets muted.

Full Review","I love this game. In all honesty, this could be better, but the game already is SUPER GOOD. I of course would recommend this to anyone. Personally, I think this game is slightly going to sci-fi themes into each season, and it just doesn't fit pubg well. It is kind of turning into Fortnite. I would s...

Even though I play on Samsung Galaxy S10, It doesn't run as smoothly as it should run. There is also a glitch with ...
Full Review","Hackers and rigged crates, it feels like the developers only see us players as cash cows. They don't listen to our concerns about the current state of the game, instead they (the developers) release skins which gives little to no impact with the game whatsoever.
