"When you log out, you lose all your downloaded content. This is an extremely dumb design when coupled with the fact that this app will randomly log you out throughout the day. Also, there are ads. You can skip the ads, but to even have them in the first place when I'm paying for this service is anmo...
Full Review","I loved howyou can choose which device you can watch it. The captions are nice and big. I think they can fix how we search for movies. Every time i search it keeps bringing me to the beginning when i was half way through the list. I love searching though because i can look up a topic like sex traffi...
Full Review","Works well enough but the OS is less than I would expect from such a behemoth of a company. It often restarts or skips(depending on how much has been played) the episode & goes to the next one automatically, when theres like 15 mins left- for example. Also when browsing the long list of movies or sh...
Full Review","Good App but why the constant update. Fed up with the regular requirement to update the App. Whenever i try to open the App it asks to update it before even i can get to the main menu. My storage space is always limited on my phone no matter how big the storage size is. So regular updates becomes a ...

Optimise the app so that it loads quicker 3. Change the Logo design. 4. Optimise the videos so that they have better video qual...
Full Review","Playback is excellent. However, what is so frustrating is the search facility. I have tried searching for movies that i know are available but never once did they come up in the results. For instance, a search for ""Bourne Ultimatum"" will show hundreds of movies except the Bourne Ultimatum. This flaw...
Full Review","Interface needs a lot of work. Go to action and adventure, for instance, scroll down the list, click on a movie, press back button, you are back at the top of the list. If you've scrolled through a list of comedies, for instance, then switch to another app like IMDB, then back to this app, you're ba...
Full Review","My favourite App, simply put. Everything is polished supremely: Great UI, incredibly user-friendly and responsive, WAY better content than the competitors, no ""this isn't available in your country"" bullcrap, multi-language support and subtitles in 30 languages. A song plays? You get full info about ...
Full Review","This app is useful to me. The movies are easily found, and a detailed description as well as trailer clips are available prior to making any decisions. As a prime member, movies are free of charge which is greatl for our while family. If you have a question, concern, an issue needing immediate atten...
Full Review","I'm constantly running into video playback issues. Constant buffering even with a fast internet connection. Also, this app seems to struggle remembering where i left off in a specific show (movies play better as a whole). I want to give this app a good review because it has a decent selection of qua...

I've tried a couple of times to get help and you get the standard call us but no acknowledgement of the issue. Has anyone e...
Full Review","The video quality is not as much as Netflix. The subtitles are so large. If we on them we will not see the video clearly. The settings are worst. The selection of video quality should be on the video but it will be in the stuff. The background and the entry into the app will not attract us. Compare ...
Full Review","Amazon Prime Video is a fairly good app, easy to use; however, timeframe to have next episode of programs takes far too long to be accessible (6-7 days). I worked in communication for ""Pay for View"" & ""On Demand"" programming and provide customers with access within 48 hrs after programs aired. Amazo...
Full Review","This app is hard to cast I got Netflix, tubi and Disney+ they're all easy to cast I'm not trying to figure out how too I'm also trying to cancel my subscription before payment is do at the moment I'm using my 30 day free trial but can't seemed to find my account with Bank info I have not yet watched...
Full Review","Heaps of movies that were previously available with the subscription were gradually removed, & now you have added the option to pay extra to hire or buy them!? Dodgy move. Disappointed. Also hate that I can't download on the PS4, doesn't even have the option. Streaming burns through too much data.","This is a comment for prime video in general. I've grown to really like prime video. I got the subscription for the shipping perks and stayed for the entertainment. There are some good original shows and rights to things I like. However, lately I've been extremely frustrated with the ads/trailers I'...

I could watch movies while screen mirroring/casting phone to TV with earlier app. But after recent update, i am not able to watch movies while casting. I am seeing only dark screen on T...
Full Review","It's by far my favorite app & the one I use most often. I luv PBS, BBC & Master Theater films & series. I also luv period pieces like Downton Abbey, Indian Summer, The Durrells in Corfu & The Amazing Mrs. Maisel (just to name a few). Amazon Prime not only has the best of the best of all the forement...
Full Review","Never brings desired result on search. I cant understand why they are showing more seasons of ""Four more shots"". We are fed up of this series. They are overdoing it. No one likes this boring series. It is like daily soap serial which is damn boring. Please dont torcher by showing it again and again....
Full Review","On Android TV this app is pretty terrible. X-ray is intrusive, hard to exit. When screen sleeps, app crashes and you are returned to home screen. Video checkpoints are way too far apart and if you miss one you have to rewatch quite a bit of content. Seriously underwhelming and a sad piece of softwar...
Full Review","Very disappointed expected many more top titles. There is one top film. Says rent or buy. I'm not paying 10 or 15 for a one off. Expected more free if its 80Â£ a yr. Lots of old stuff we've seen before. TV progs lots I've never heard of. Why if it says downloadable film or tv series included with pri...
Full Review","Diamond in the rough. So this is a work in progress at best. It has some great features, but... Where to begin? Well, the most annoying gotcha is in navigating watch lists. Pop into a video for details, but you are returned to the top of the list. Hey, it's a pain to keep scrolling back to my origin...
Full Review","The movies and series included here are great, excellent selection. However, the insist on playing trailers before starting a selection and even in the middle of a binge. EXTREMELY ANOYING!!!! Main reason for the low rating. The app, overall, has bugs that need work, particularly when casting (I use...
Full Review","Honestly the adverts need to stop during everything you watch. Remove them and I'll rate higher untill then netflix and Disney + are better sort it out!!!

Full Review","Controls on the app stop working within a minute if beginning to watch any program. You cannot pause, forward, change offering and what not. The app needs to be killed and started again for less than a minute of control time. This is very frustrating when you are watching a show or movie and want to...
Full Review","Terrible experience on the Home page. I find a subject/genre I like, click into a few of the interesting choices, but when I hit back, to view more, it resets the Home page and doesn't even have the genre I was browsing! If I clicked on a show/movie in a genre list, it probably means I was intereste...
Full Review","I have always loved watching things on this app. I wiped out my phone 6 months ago which made me forget about this, but when I was thinking of watching a film that scared me as a kid (but I'm older now and I've played some horror games for example FNAF) and I couldnt find it on Netflix. So I came ba...

Pinch and zoom needs to be added instead of pressing the 3 dots then 'zoom'. 2. Brightness controls whilst watching. 3. Double tap seeking, forward or backward...
Full Review","Needs Chromecast support, especially when pretty every streaming service I have encountered or looked into has it, kind of silly for Amazon to be a hold out(Has now been added). Also to have Prime videos ads at the start of a video, is redundant. I am in the app, I can see the originals right there,...
Full Review","The app is terrible, the developers should take a page from the ones that do the Netflix app, that can work on 10 year old smartphones. The Prime Video app has trouble running glitch free on smart TVs or Blu-ray players that are 3 years old...and don't get me started on the rewind and forward....and...
Full Review","Still the worst streaming app. This is a paid service. You pay for this service. Yet they place ads still and while they let you skip. These come on before you watch a show and after most episodes. They spoil shows I want to watch and I don't want to watch them on a service I'm paying for. You're UI...
Full Review","Pathetic app controls It doesn't even have a proper filter function. Filter has two options: movies and TV shows.

Full Review","Poor - missing basic functionality. We watch programs in English and have to watch whole programs also with English subtitles because any speaking in other languages isn't subtitled in English to match the audio! How basic is that! Disappointing. And not even a new problem, it's been like this for y...

Had to go through my Amazon prime app and select videos and watch from there when this app....stuttered. (best way to describe it but- the video's ...
Full Review","Good, but slow and unreliable. Watching shows works well enough, but the app takes up a considerable amount of RAM which means that multi-tasking out of it often leads to stuttery and glitchy behaviour such as the app not responding or showing the opening animation multiple times and sometimes even ...

Added a star) 1) FIXED!! 2) The ads that respond to your ""skip"" command by lingering for a full second or two, and then closing in an otherwise ""instant response"" app experience are completely unnecessary. Feels like FORCE. Don't I pay for ""Prime""...
Full Review","The app looks to be optimized to show new shows instead of regularly scheduled ones. I wish there were a show time guide, sort of like what use to be in the newspaper, where i could look at the show guide, and see what days my shows will be available to watch. The current method of favorite or stare...
Full Review","Your UI sucks and its not well categorised... Its fails to show the variety of shows available. Its the worst in terms of app UI if compared to Netflix and Hotstar. Fix your UI to show variety of shows available. But I loved the way imdb cast is displayed as characters are played on screen. Please a...
Full Review","There are occasional issues with the ""cast"" feature of the app, such as not being able to see certain devices when other apps are able to. Reconnecting to certain devices often fail, requiring the app to be restarted. Other than that the app is great. Fix the casting issues and it would get 5 stars.","The app for TV is just horrible, like seriously, I can't believe how it can be so bad. It's sluggish and makes watching anything feel like it's a chore. Sometimes there's just no video or sound, just the subtitles; I have to watch the episode somewhere else. Trailers between episodes? It's all so ri...
Full Review","I really like this app. The experience with it is very smooth and I think it has some fantastic features. I love how you can touch the screen during a show and it will give you information about the actors present in the scene as well as the name of any songs being played and trivia. I also love tha...
Full Review","Not a bad app, and pretty much required to watch Prime videos. I don't know if the UI is better on a phone, but on my Android TV box using a Bluetooth keyboard navigation is not as easy or logical as it should be. I mostly use arrow keys to get around and often when scrolling up a list of episodes w...
Full Review","I probably watch more video on prime than the other main streaming services, but the app is definitely the worst laid out.

Full Review","Best App for watching shows and movies. It has great collection of movies, shows stand up comedies, etc. It is also available in different languages and also contains stuff for different languages.

I tried one of the recommended solution - to uninstall and install the app and it worked for one episode but again started ha...
Full Review","Awesome! Great for watching movies and TV Shows, and it's compatible with Google Chrome Cast. The only suggestion I would say would be to make it a little easier to find trailers for the content available.

I can't even get to where i left off in a show because when I skip ahead after one ad, it plays another 3 minute ad.. if its not fixed within the next month, I will update this rating accordingly.
