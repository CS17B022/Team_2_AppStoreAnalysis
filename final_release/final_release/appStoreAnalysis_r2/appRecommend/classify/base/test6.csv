Please fix this issue by any means because whatever be the problems i truly love this app.,"I'm unable to link my SIMPL account with Zomato, and I've been requesting Zomato for past 4 weeks to resolve the issue - but they've no time to resolve the issue. Hence, I've decided to uninstall this app since I'm very much unhappy with their services.",There is no option to change firstly registered mobile number in personal details field.

I really enjoy to find my lovely place to hang out a experiencing a good platform for my delicious and good food.. Thankq Zomato,The charges are double compare to swiggy. I was using swiggy earlier.

No difference for gold customers..,"Require your kind attention. Whenever I order something I couldn't see my order details. Every time it says app not working. This is happening from last 2 days.

Every time they are saying 4-5 days like this they repeated for 4 times and my money wasn't get back,It's an nice application and I dnt face any issue while ordering. But if it's possible to give discount on a order than that will be great. However no issue with the application,"It kept deleting my cart every 5 minutes. When I tried logging in through manual OTP, it kept logging me out saying the OTP that Zomato itself sent was incorrect. Horrible experience. Waste of time!!","Zomato is my go-to-app whenever I want to order something from outside. Never faced any glitch so far so basically quite happy with the overall performance of the app. However, lately I have been facing issues with choosing meal since there are so many options to select from.

Full Review",The application crashes everytime I open the new groceries section. Please recommend.,"Zomato Gold is great. The app is one of two that's widely used for food deliveries. However, if you like to write reviews, this app is frustrating. Constantly, photos get deleted from reviews. You have to reach out to them via email to reinstate photos. It's ridiculous and time consuming. I have no ...
Full Review","Works fine...but there are few issues regarding it that I want to mention. There is no point in giving 40% off when you're gonna add more Rs.30-40 to the cart value..and then apply the discount. So eventually you end up getting only 10-20 Rs discount. Useless. Also I dunno why my phone hangs/switche...

Had to cancel twice. Online chat is useless because the agents take forever to resolve the delay in delivery issue. Disappointed twice.,You made my day special 😘😍 Thank you Zomato. I just love that how quickly you adapt to the surrounding situations. Loved the product thoughts and developers efforts. Keep delighting us.,"The address and the maps are totally out of sync, once it picks the random place in the map, then it hides and doesn't allow the user to see let alone edit the address.

Full Review","Don't buy gold. It's just a stupid way to make you spend more. Also the service provided by Zomato has gone done in the past few years. The chat takes customers for granted and doesn't provide with a solution. Go for swiggy super. A much better alternative and you always get your order before time. ...

Loving it.,"I never gave permission for the app to read my sms , but whenever an OTP is received it detects the OTP and also shows a pop-up screen asking to accept or deny it.

It doesnt matter how many times you try, the restaurants always remain open but you cannot order anything. The customer support is the best, there is no way to contact them.","Total waste. Why does everytime , I switch on my location, zomato needs to update that location? Second time I am facing the issue, despite selecting my saved home address , the food is delivered to someplace else , because the app itself updated the location. I already lost money once and again I h...
Full Review","The UI has improved greatly as compared to previous versions. Zomato's service has always been quite good, only the app had made it very clunky and difficult to use them in the past and so left many of its features orphaned by the presentation.
